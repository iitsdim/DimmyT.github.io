intro: |
  I am a 17 years old pupil from High school, who enjoy coding and problem-solving.<br/><br/>
  Firstly, I would like to present some background information about myself. Since childhood, I have two interesting hobbies: football and legerdemain. I played football in almost every place where I was. In fact, when I was in olympiad Tuymaada, I created a team with other country delegations and won the tournament of football. Furthermore, I even have a goblet as the winner. Furthermore, I even have a goblet as the winner. Interest in magic tricks, I used in the school event where is I show plenty of which. Last five years, I found another pleasure for me - the IT Olympiad club. During this period, I made significant progress in computer science and showed great performance in many competitions at international and national levels. As one of the top achievers of my country in 2019, I was one of the fifteen students who qualified to be a participant in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). Unfortunately for me, I was ranked 5th place after elimination olympiads results while the top 4 students participated in IOI 2019 in Baku.
